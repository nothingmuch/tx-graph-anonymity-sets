# Part 10: some remarks on the "out of scope" things

- temporal patterns, availability
- bitcoin p2p protocol, auxilliary protocols (electrum etc)
  - tor exists, but it needs to be used correctly
- BIP 37, Jonas Nick's thesis, unreasonable effectiveness of address clustering
- dust attacks
- KYC snafus (Celsius, etc)
- MtGoxAndOthers
- payjoin, coinswap, lightning nodes
  - payjoins are covert, break sub-transaction assumption
    - if widely used, this leaves the sub-transaction model under constrained as the "fees" are allowed to range to arbitrary values
- ordinals
  - in principle, nothing prevents privacy preserving exchange of ordinals through coinjoins
  - but also ordinal theory is kind of an attack on fungibility by definition boo hiss
  
- ... basically recycle btc femmes / bitcoin privacy curriculum materials, and point to belcher's Privacy wiki page for a broader overview?
