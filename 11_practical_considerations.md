# Part 10: Practical considerations

- sub-txn model is intractable to compute for large transaction
  - equal outputs and radix coinjoin special cases
  - subset sum estimation
    - sparse convolution
    - generating functions
    - linear sketches
- path based model
  - data availability
- expander graphs
  - random graphs are typically expanders
  - are partly randomized DAGs that? is the degree of randomization within classes of similar coins enough to give rise to expander properties?
